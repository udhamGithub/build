1.If there is same code How it get handle on Diffrent Os and processor
         -Exe>
            myprogram.exe-windows
            myprogram.out-linux
          -How Os Load the program in main memory?        
          -Cross compiler
          -
2.Platform Independent Message?
        -I sent one message from pc(which fallow Bigendiness Notation)-Higher Byte of Varible  First
        
        to another PC ,which is follow Little endianess[lower Byte of Varible  First] of memory storage
        for storing the variable in memory adress.
        
        
         //Transmitter thread    
         
         struct Userdata
         {
         
         
         
         }        
         
         structure FrameFormate
         {
             struct
             {
                int  Header// 4 byte    [0 1 2 3  4 5 6 7  8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ;
             }
             char *data;         
         };        
         
        Send lenth()
        ConvertIntoBigEndinessOfMessage()
        SendMessage()


        //Transmitter thread
        

3.What is the benifit of littele endian or big endian?
4.What is Opeque Pointer
5.Wha is structure of Process contol block,Thread control block, what is common b/w both?
